# Superkabe — Full AI Context

> Superkabe is an infrastructure protection layer for outbound email teams. It sits between lead enrichment tools (Clay) and email sending platforms (Smartlead, Instantly, EmailBison) to monitor bounce rates, enforce DNS authentication, detect mailbox fatigue, and score lead health in real time. The goal: prevent domain burnout and protect sender reputation before damage becomes irreversible.

## What Superkabe Does

Superkabe does NOT send emails. It monitors and protects the infrastructure that does. Key capabilities:

- **Bounce Rate Monitoring**: Tiered thresholds (warning at 5%, critical at 10%) with sliding window analysis
- **DNS Authentication Enforcement**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC validation per domain
- **Mailbox Fatigue Detection**: Tracks send volume, bounce patterns, and cooldown periods per mailbox
- **Lead Health Scoring**: Classifies leads as GREEN (80-100), YELLOW (50-79), or RED (0-49) before they enter campaigns
- **Execution Gate**: Two-stage gate that blocks bad leads and protects unhealthy infrastructure
- **Auto-Healing**: 5-phase recovery pipeline that automatically heals paused mailboxes via warmup
- **State Machine**: Manages mailbox lifecycle through active, warning, paused, healing, and recovered states
- **Risk Scoring**: Separates hard signals (bounces) from soft signals (velocity spikes) for accurate risk assessment

## Integrations

### Smartlead
Real-time bounce monitoring, campaign health tracking, mailbox protection. Syncs campaigns, mailboxes, and lead activity every 20 minutes. Automatically pauses mailboxes exceeding bounce thresholds.

### Clay
Webhook-based lead ingestion. Enriched leads from Clay tables are routed through the execution gate, health-scored, and pushed to appropriate Smartlead campaigns based on persona matching and minimum score rules.

### Instantly
Campaign sync, per-mailbox engagement tracking, and deliverability protection. Monitors inbox placement and sender reputation across Instantly accounts.

### EmailBison
Ingests warm-up metrics, engagement tracking, and reputation scoring. Monitors warmup health and detects mailboxes that need attention.

### Slack
Real-time infrastructure alerts. Notifies teams when mailboxes are paused, domains are unhealthy, or bounce rates spike. Two-way: query infrastructure status from Slack.

### API & Webhooks
Direct lead ingestion API, Clay webhook endpoint, Smartlead event webhook, and campaign resolution API for automating stalled campaign recovery.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 App Router, deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with Prisma ORM, deployed on Railway
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring**: Cron-based sync every 20 minutes, event-driven webhook processing
- **Rate Limits**: Smartlead API — 10 requests per 2 seconds, max 100 leads per batch

## System Modes

1. **Observe**: Logs all events, no automated actions. For learning baseline metrics.
2. **Suggest**: Provides recommendations without blocking. For reviewing suggestions before automation.
3. **Enforce**: Fully automated pausing and blocking. Production-ready protection.

## Pricing

Starting at $49/month. Includes infrastructure monitoring, auto-healing, multi-platform sync, and Slack alerts.
